CVC-ClinicDB

--------------------------------------------------
Introduction
--------------------------------------------------

CVC-ClinicDB is a database of frames extracted from colonoscopy videos. 
These frames contain several examples of polyps. In addition to the frames, we provide the ground truth for the polyps. 
This ground truth consists of a mask corresponding to the region covered by the polyp in the image.

CVC-ClinicDB has been generated from 25 different video studies. For each study at least a sequence containing a polyp was extracted. Considering this, CVC-ClinicDB database is composed by frames from 29 different sequences containing a polyp. 

Finally, a set of frames were selected from each sequence, paying particular attention in showing several points of view of the polyp.

Description
--------------------------------------------------

The database consists of two different types of images:
1) Original images: original/frame_number.tiff
2) Polyp mask: ground truth/frame_number.tiff

The correspondence between the number of frame and the video sequence is as follows:
